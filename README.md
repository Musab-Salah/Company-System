# Company-System-Trainning-Project-
This project was for the training, I built the project from scratch, I applied all the important and fundamental things with the database (REST APIs), the project was not completed in terms of design because of the shortened training period that was only a month, but I did a very big job and I learned a lot in this short period.

##TECHNOLOGIES:
Backend: ASP.NET, C#, SQL, Entity Framework.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, TypeScript (Angular)
